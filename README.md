- 👋 Hi, I’m @CorryGrey
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python and becoming a Python developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python by taking online courses (mostly YouTube videos). ex: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that will help teach me best practices while I learn.
- 📫 How to reach me by simply messaging me on GitHub :)
